### Conclusions and/or Observations
- Overall sales were highest in the year 2017 and in the store located in New York, Baldwin Bikes.
- New York and Texas both had the highest sales in 2017 with much lower sales the year before and the year after. California was steady with high sales in 2016 and 2017 before a smaller drop in sales in 2018 compared to the other states. 
- While there were peaks and valleys in sales by month in 2016 and 2017, I noticed greater extremes in 2018. There was a significant peak in April prior to much lower and flatter sales for the remainder of the year. This was true of the stores in all three states. 


### My Recommendations
- I think some additional data are needed to help clarify why the New York store is most successful. What is the area like where the store is located? What are customers using the bicycles for in all locations? Are there any other differences with the New York location compared to the others?
- This question needs to be answered: What happened in 2018 in April and then in the following months?
